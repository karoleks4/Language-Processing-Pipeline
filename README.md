# Language-Processing-Pipeline
The Language Processing Pipeline for Micro-Haskell implemented in Java.

This porgram illustrates the language processing pipeline in the case of a small fragment of the Haskell programming language (Micro-Haskell or MH).
The practical illustrates all stages of the language processing pipeline for programming languages, taking us from a source file, written in MH, to execution of the program.
The program consists of:
- Lexing
- Parsing (LL(1) parser)
- Typechecking 
- Evaluation (simple evaluator provided)

More info in "Description.pdf" file (the description does not match the program fully since I took this course during the previous academic year).

This code was generated for Assignment 1 for Informatics 2A course (Processing Formal and Natural Languages) at the University of Edinburgh.
